## Lion Ages

- Biologists are interested in examining the relationship between the age of lions and the proportion of their nose that is black.
- Data is collected from a group of lions whose ages are known.
- The hope is to develop a model to predict the age of lions with unknown age from something that can be measured from a distance with minimal interference from an image of the lion's face.
- Experts use multiple characteristics in addition to nose color, such as mane length, teeth wear, and facial scarring.

### Data

```{r}
lions = read_csv("../../data/lions.csv") %>% 
  rename(black = proportion.black)
```

### Numerical Summary

- Calculate:
    - the number of cases;
    - means and standard deviations of each variable;
    - the correlation (more on this below)

```{r}
## first few rows
head(lions)

lions_sum = lions %>% 
  summarize(across(everything(), list(mean = mean, sd = sd)),
            n = n(),
            r = cor(age, black)) %>% 
  relocate(n)

lions_sum            
```

### Graphical Summary

- We use a scatter plot to show the relationship between these variables
- Add a simple linear regression line with `geom_smooth()`.

```{r}
ggplot(lions, aes(x = age, y = black)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Age (years)") +
  ylab("Percentage Black") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  ggtitle("Ages and Lion Nose Color") +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")
```

- We see a positive relationship between `age` and the proportion of the nose which is black.
    - As lions get older, the percentage of the nose that is black tends to increase
    - There is a fair amount of variability in this relationship, though
- How can we measure the strength of a linear relationship?

### The Correlation Coefficient r

- The *correlation coefficient* `r` is a measure of the strength of a linear relationship between two quantitative variables.
- The formula is

$$
r = \mathsf{Corr}(x,y) = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n
\left(\frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s_x} \right)
\left(\frac{y_i - \bar{y}}{s_y} \right)
$$

- From the equation, note that:
    - $\mathsf{Corr}(x,y) = \mathsf{Corr}(y,x)$
        - The order of the variables does not matter
    - The individual values of $x$ and $y$ are standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation (z scores)
    - $r$ is the average of the product of these standardized values
        - The $n-1$ in the denominator is because sample standard deviations $s_x$ and $s_y$ use $n-1$.
        - If we instead used the population standard deviation formula with $n$ and not $n-1$, then there would be a leading $1/n$ and not $1/(n-1)$
    - $r$ is unitless
        - Any units in $x$ and $y$ are eliminated in standardization
        - Changing the scale of measurement of $x$ and/or $y$ does not change $r$
    - For cases where $x$ and $y$ are both greater than their mean or less than their mean, the sum gets bigger as the product is positive
    - For cases where one of $x$ and $y$ is greater than its mean and the other is less than it mean, the product is negative and the sum is made smaller
- Not obvious from the equation, but provable with a mathematical argument is that $-1 \le r \le 1$.
- $r=1$ if and only if the points fall exactly on a line with a positive slope
- $r = -1$ if and only if the points fall exactly on a line with a negative slope

```{r}
ggplot(lions, aes(x = age, y = black)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Age (years)") +
  ylab("Percentage Black") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  ggtitle("Ages and Lion Nose Color",
          subtitle = "Red dashed lines at variable means") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = lions_sum$age_mean, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = lions_sum$black_mean, color = "red", linetype = "dashed")
```

- Almost all points are in the upper right or lower left, so $r > 0$.
- The points are not on exactly straight line with a positive slope, so $r < 1$.

### Calculation

- The built-in R function `cor()` calculate the correlation coefficient.

```{r}
x = lions %>% pull(age)
y = lions %>% pull(black)
cor(x,y)
```

- Demonstrate with a manual calculation

```{r}
lions_calc = lions %>% 
  mutate(z_age = (age - mean(age))/sd(age),
         z_black = (black - mean(black))/sd(black),
         prod = z_age * z_black)

lions_calc %>% 
  print(n = Inf)

lions_calc %>% 
  summarize(r = sum(prod) / (nrow(.) - 1)) %>% 
  pull(r)
```

### Fake Data Examples

```{r, echo = FALSE}
x1 = seq(-2,2,0.05)
y1 = x1^2
x2 = x1[x1>0]
y2 = y1[x1>0]
x3 = x1[x1<0]
y3 = y1[x1<0]
x4 = x1
y4 = x4 + rnorm(length(x4),0,0.3)
x5 = x1
y5 = x5 + rnorm(length(x5),0,4)

cor_plot = function(x,y)
{
  ggplot(tibble(x,y), aes(x=x, y=y)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm") +
    geom_vline(xintercept = mean(x), color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = mean(y), color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
    ggtitle(str_c("r = ", round(cor(x,y),2)))
}
```

```{r, fig.height = 4}
cor_plot(x1,y1)
```

- $r=0$, but there is a deterministic non-linear relationship between $x$ and $y$

> $r=0$ and there is a weak linear relationship but a strong non-linear relationship between $x$ and $y$

```{r, fig.height = 4}
cor_plot(x2,y2)
```

- $r$ near one
- the points are more tightly clustered around the blue line with a positive slope than around the horizontal red dashed line
- but, a non-linear relationship is superior to a simpler linear relationship

> $r=0.97$ and there is a strong linear relationship but an even stronger non-linear relationship between $x$ and $y$

```{r, fig.height = 4}
cor_plot(x3,y3)
```

- $r$ is near $-1$
- the points are more tightly clustered around the blue line with a negative slope than around the horizontal red dashed line
- but, a non-linear relationship is superior to a simpler linear relationship

> $r=-0.97$ and there is a strong linear relationship but an even stronger non-linear relationship between $x$ and $y$

```{r, fig.height = 4}
cor_plot(x4,y4)
```

- $r$ near one
- the points are more tightly clustered around the blue line with a positive slope than around the horizontal red dashed line
- a simpler linear relationship is an adequate summary of the data
    - there is no non-linear relationship that is a substantially better fit to the data
    
> $r=0.97$ and there is a strong linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ which is not substantially improved by a nonlinear relationship

```{r, fig.height = 4}
cor_plot(x5,y5)
```

- $r$ is small and positive
- the points are more tightly clustered around the blue line with a positive slope than around the horizontal red dashed line, but only by a smallish amount
- the strength of the linear relationship is weak
- a simpler linear relationship is an adequate summary of the data
    - there is no non-linear relationship that is a substantially better fit to the data   
    
> $r=0.25$ and there is a weak linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ which is not substantially improved by a nonlinear relationship

#### The Take-home Message

- $r$ is a measure of the strength of the **linear** relationship between two quantitative variables
- The value of $r$ alone says nothing about the strength of any potential non-linear relationships
- Graph your data!
